<h1>History of C++ </h1>
C++ was created in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup. It was written as an extension of C programming language. C++ is a multi-purpose programming language, which is applied in desktop applications (Adobe systems such as Illustrator, Photoshop,..), video games (CSGO, League of Legends, PUBG, Call of Duty), servers core of e-commerse, web search or databases (Firstfox, google applications, MySQL) and performance-critical applications such as operating Systems (Apple OS, Microsoft Windows OS), banking applications (Infosys Finacle)

<h1>Getting started </h1>
To install C++, we need to have an IDE that have our langugae package. In my case, I choose Visual studio which has package C/C++. Then I need to install the compiler for C ++ named **msys2** so that I we can run C++ on our device.
C++ has another recommended IDE that is Visual Studio, but due to some reasons I could not run HelloWorld on this IDE. Therefore I have chosen Visual studio which is more familiar to me as an IDE. 
<br>
To run program in C++, we just need to write program which has the header (#include <iostream>) and main component (int main()) then run it by the key combination **Crtl + Alt + N**. 
<br>
For example:
<br>
```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
